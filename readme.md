Oh man, it's a beautiful day to run across the coastline. But watch out, there are a bunch of baby turtles that just hatched across your path! Welcome to "Beach Runner'' where the point of the game is to see how far you can run without running over on turtles!


The inspiration for this game came from the google offline Dinosaur Game. However, I wanted to use my love for Css to brighten it up a little.


In this game the player(you) is represented by a purple square. Your goal is to avoid turtles as you run by them by pressing the spacebar to move out of their way.


This game was built with Html, Css, Javascript and Canvas. The Html allows the Js to be connected to the website. The Css makes the background look like a beach, the Javascript records clicks and variables while the bulk of the game is on Canvas. I chose to use Canvas because when doing research on a game I found that many used it (even the google offline Dinosaur Game).


In the future, I plan on using Canvas's context and drawing features to draw more detailed characters. I would also like to find a way to animate those characters along with the ocean and setting sun.


Hope you like the game!
